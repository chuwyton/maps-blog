## The Map
The network between Osaka and Kyoto projects a much clearer separation of the railway networks between the two cities, as compared to the megalopolis of the Greater Tokyo Area. I hence had a very refreshing time drawing this map, and the fact that there were two centres of focus which had to fit comfortably within the confines of my canvas offered a new challenge in planning. As compared to the previous map of Tokyo, many more guides were drawn - in fact, for this map, all of the drawn lines had a guide underneath.  

There are many firsts for this map. I experimented with a 15&deg; constraint, which provided me with a far more flexible layout than the 45&deg; constraints I was used to, but where possible, I kept the angles to 30&deg;/45&deg; multiples, to prevent the map from looking too messy. I'd like to think that the overall result was a pretty balance of having a structured grid locally, whilst not being too stubborn on a global scale. I will continue to adopt this in my next map.  

This was also my first attempt at applying a more standard typeface for labelling. The stations were written more-or-less in a natural style, although grids were applied for virtually all labels, to maintain consistency in size. For line names, I drew the text bigger, emboldened it, and added serifs as I saw fit. I referred to sample text generators for the Meiryo font, but after a while I grew tired and figured I had gotten the general gist of when to make the strokes thicker and when not to.  

I wanted to apply this style to major stations also, but somewhere along the way I forgot, so I'm eager to try this out for the next map.  

Another first - I used curves instead of kinks for all my lines. I liked the effect, and it especially helped to detangle complicated junctions (especially after Tennoji). But this was a much more painstaking endeavour than simply connecting straight lines together, as each bend and corner required the prior placement of guide circles. Nevertheless, it was well worth it. I still like the computerish, PCU board-like style of the 45&deg; kinks though.

For through services, I used smaller station markers and thinner lines (single- instead of double-width) to denote them. But was not very disciplined in this - I only decided on the markers (and played around with them) while drawing the Karasuma Line down Kintetsu Kyoto Line, and by that time most of the lines on the Hankyu side had already been drawn, so there wasn't any space to draw any lines beyond Takatsuki.  

I also misestimated the position of Nara station and had to draw a pretty steep line from Ikoma to the eastern side of Osaka.  

And as with most attempts, there are mistakes here and there - nothing which would severly impact the accurate interpretation of the map, however.

## Visiting Osaka and Kyoto
I have never been to Osaka, in the strictest sense. Of the four or five times I have been there, it was mainly as a hub to different places around West honshu (enabled mostly by the generous usage of the JR Pass). I spent one night around Tennoji (that place which offers supersized meals for everything) with a bunch of friends during my university graduation trip of 2018, and about nine hours the next day at a karaoke near our Airbnb at Shin-Osaka, as the typhoon made its way through the city. It was fun.  

Using Osaka as a base to return to, I have visited Kyoto a few times. Apart from the usual temples and such, Kyoto also offered nice and quaint alleyways with small rivulets flowing alongside, carrying with it the freshly fallen green leaves from the willows planted in between. I would imagine that it would be an enjoyable experience to go down in the water during the summer.  

Both Osaka and Kyoto were where I experienced my first visit to large station buildings. The tall and cavernous chasm of the Kyoto station building, which looked surprisingly light given its glass facade, and the sheer scale of the multistoreyed roof of Osaka station, astounded me. It was a breathtaking experience - a very different kind of amazement compared to the general hubbub and complexity of Tokyo and Shinjuku. I felt like I was in a cathedral for railways.
