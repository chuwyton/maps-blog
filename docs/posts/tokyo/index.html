I can't remember exactly when, but it was after my first trip to Tokyo with family in 2004, when I was 10. I do remember getting enthralled by the utter complexity that the map in the tourist guidebook we brought along had to offer. I had never seen so many colors on a transit map before in my life. But even then, I noticed that some lines were of the same color, which led to confusion about which line was which - and worse, where the lines went when two of them crossed. (I would later find out that there was one color for all the &quot;minor&quot; JR Lines, and one color for all private railways. Only the subway had their own lines.) So I went about copying the guidebook version, drawing the lines as unambiguously as I could. I didn't use color then; I only had a ball-point pen and some lined paper lying around, which I would glue together when the map got too big.</p> <p>Over the years, I would re-draw the map I had copied, making revisions and attempting to expand beyond the area the guidebook covered. 2012 was a particularly good year, because I started to reference Google Maps for the actual alignment of the lines, and so I wasn't bound by other maps which I referenced. By the end of 2012, I had completed a draft on lined paper, and bought a set of colored gel pens that I used to copy to a large sheet of drawing paper which I had purchased from an art store. That map formed the predecessor to the map here.</p> <p>As far as I know, this map is the seventh revision to the first map I drew. (I'll post some pictures of maps of the other revisions sometime in the future.)</p> <p>The general idea behind the Tokyo map, as is with most unofficial ones, is to make one that encompasses all the companies. There are two subway operators, a (privatised) national operator, seven major private railway operators, and dozens of minor ones. Each company has their own map, but usually prioritises only their lines (and through-service lines; other lines which they continue to run into) on the map, relegating other lines to thin, grey ones on the map. I wanted one which had all of them.</p> <p>For this map, each line gets its own color, except for Shinkansen lines, which all share the same colour. The colours are as close as the official line colours I could get with the 16-colour set of pens. The Shonan-Shinjuku Line gets two colours.</p> <p>Each line is drawn &quot;double-width&quot;: they are not drawn with a thick pen, but rather a line is drawn, and then another is drawn immediately next to it. I liked the idea of &quot;hand-drawn straight lines&quot; - they were straight, but not as if you had used a ruler to draw them: there are places where the line shifts and bends just enough to see that a person had drawn it, rather than having it printed. But using only single-width lines made the shifts and bends stand out just a little too much - the double-width lines helped to mitigate that.</p> <p>I did not use a ruler to draw any of the lines. I did prop a few perpendicular guide lines using a pencil, but apart from it everything was calibrated by eyeballing only. The horizontal and vertical lines I think were okay, but the slope of the 45Â° lines differ quite a bit from segment to segment.</p> <p>There were several mistakes made, which were later patched up. You might be able to see the locations which I cut and replaced the part where I had made an error - see if you can find them all!</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
