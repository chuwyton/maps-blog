I can't remember exactly when, but it was after my first trip to Tokyo with family in 2004, when I was 10. I do remember getting enthralled by the utter complexity that the map in the tourist guidebook we brought along had to offer. I had never seen so many colors on a transit map before in my life. But even then, I noticed that some lines were of the same color, which led to confusion about which line was which - and worse, where the lines went when two of them crossed. (I would later find out that there was one color for all the \"minor\" JR Lines, and one color for all private railways. Only the subway had their own lines.)
