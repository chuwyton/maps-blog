One thing which makes Japanese railway systems challenging and exciting to draw is their rather special situation in terms of its railway market — whereas most cities and countries employ only a few operators (sometimes only one), cities in Japan, especially big cities like Osaka and Tokyo, can have a whole host of operators both competing and collaborating with each other. As a result, unique arrangements in railway operations can arise. For example, many subway lines in Tokyo have \"through service\" — that is, they don't stop at their termini, but continue along another company's lines.

Firstly, digital software such as Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator allow you to re-do the layout, and the look and feel of your map, if you've made a mistake. So you have lots of freedom to try out stuff and see if it works, and finally arrive at a perfect, or near-perfect, version of the map.
